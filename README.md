# My-Profile
TJHSST '21. I'm an aspiring bioengineer-advocate. I'm currently involved in the TJHSST neuroscience research lab, where I'm conducting a project on multiple sclerosis protein biomarkers. I've completed two summer internship under ASSIP at George Mason University in Bioengineering departments and am currently involved in NIH-funded Bioimaging research. Apart from  my academic pursuits, I'm heavily involved in health presentations and literary outreach, piano (both pop and classical), and lacrosse.
